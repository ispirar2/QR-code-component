## My process

I began by analyzing the given design picture attached with the challenge folder so I can know with how
I should write my css in order to get the same design.
Then made the changes that I needed to the html file and after that I took the styling instruction like:
colors, font family and font size, from style guide file.
I started by using flexbox and aligning all the content in the center and give the container of the qr code
and text under it there designs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned how to analyze a design in a better way and now I have better understanding of:
the box model, visual rules, and the use of flex property.

### Continued development

I going to focus more on the UI and UX designing so I can become better front-end developer
